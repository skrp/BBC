g contains metadata
Known to build file

p = aes256ecb(sha[64][%x])

k binary file = 10GB per TB
k ascii file = 20GB per TB
each hex entry is 768 bits + delimiter

- preworked
- nonsequential 
- over time
- over hosts
- uniq 64 hex pass
1) file mixed in pool of 1 billion
2) host jobs select random blocks to encrypt
3) request fill TB worth will return 100 million files 
4) each block in file discrete from other in its encryption process
